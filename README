Nimpres (Nimble Presenter)

Nimpres is Android device hosted mobile presentation sharing software. The software allows for a slideshow to be hosted and controlled 
on an Android tablet/phone and then viewed by one or more Android client devices on the LAN or over the Internet. Clients will
remain synchronized with the slideshow host and advance to the next slide when told to do so by the presenter.
