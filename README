Android Client:
	Nimpres Android Client is an android device hosted mobile presentation sharing software. The software allows for a slide show to be hosted and controlled 
	on an android tablet/phone and then viewed by one or more android client devices on the LAN or over the Internet. Clients will
	remain synchronized with the slide show host and advance to the next slide when told to do so by the presenter.
